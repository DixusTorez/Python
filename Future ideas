# Step 1: Create a list of 4 first names (rows)
first_names = ["James", "Alex", "Taylor", "Jordan"]

# Step 2: Create a list of 4 last names (columns)
last_names = ["Bond", "Carter", "Reed", "Smith"]

# Step 3: Create an empty list to store the combinations
name_combinations = []

# Step 4: Outer loop to iterate through first names
for first in first_names:
    # Step 5: Create an empty list for each first name
    row = []
    # Step 6: Inner loop to iterate through last names
    for last in last_names:
        # Step 7: Concatenate first and last names and append to the row
        row.append(first + " " + last)
    # Step 8: Append the row to the main list
    name_combinations.append(row)

# Step 9: Print the 2D list of name combinations

Fruit!
# Predefined list of flavors
flavors = ["apple", "grape", "peach", "cinnamon", "vanilla"]

# Step 1: Take user input for fruits and split them into a list
fruits = input("Enter a list of fruits: ").split()

# Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the combinations
combinations = []

# Step 3: Loop through each fruit
for fruit in fruits:
    # Step 4: Create an empty list for the current fruit's combinations
    fruit_combinations = []
    # Step 5: Loop through each flavor
    for flavor in flavors:
        # Step 6: Combine the fruit and flavor and append to the current list
        fruit_combinations.append(f"{fruit} {flavor}")
    # Step 7: Append the current list of combinations to the main list
    combinations.append(fruit_combinations)

# Step 8: Print the 2D list of combinations
print(combinations)

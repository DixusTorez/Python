print("""Who am I you may be asking? You are the legendary Gastillo of Kaizoku.

Description: Gastillo is of Mexican descent. He stands at a whopping six foot two and two hundred pounds. He has brown hair which he styles in a buzz cut. He has a multitude of augments, some of the more noticeable augments are Spyder_Eys that add black dots to the front and back of his head. They give him the ability to see in infrared, night vision and thermal as well as the ability to zoom in on targets. Another noticeable augment is a Vocal Linguistic Box. This gives him the ability to speak in any dialect but with the drawback of voice glitches and scratches.

Gastillo opens his eyes all 16 of them. He hears the fans in his head whir while the implanted Spyder_Eys all around him calibrate. It's near sickening levels of motion sickness but soon he gets used to it. He looks around at where he was sleeping, he sees he's been in cryostasis for a while, around ten years. On the left in the plush of the chamber he sees a sticky note telling him to "open his codex." First he checks his shirt pockets and then his pants. Eventually he finds it in his boots. On the codex a bright message pops up from who, Gastillo assumes, one of his friends.

"Hey man it's been a long slumber, you'll warm up eventually. You were sent here by the big man up top to take over this Vastella ship. You might've sustained some memory loss but that's okay. This codex should catch you up to speed. Or don't it doesn't really matter."

"CODEX:"
The Kaizoku:

Ships: The ships that you will be using are the Blugills and Mantisellas. Better learn how to fly fast

Mantisellas: They look like flattened out hummingbirds. Primarily used by Sabrinen as suicide bombers or defenders. Also used going fast across planets or to different planets. But you aren't no mechanic don't go tinkering with this one.

Blugills: The best ship, fast, reliable and customizable. Always take one of these. It's also extremely simple to use.

Smugglers you'll likely come across:

Buq'ah:
Huge, fleeting ships are why they got their name. Primarily an offworld smuggling operation, they use Vastellas for everything. Our main and primary threat. It's kill on sight for these guys. They'll rep it in your face like nothing.

Lasiks: Get your hands on one of these puppies. They're valuable, trustworthy and very beautiful. Just be careful with your hands they'll burn.
